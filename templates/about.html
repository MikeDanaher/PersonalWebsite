<h2>Hi, I'm Mike</h2>
<h4>Welcome to my website!</h4>
<p>I built this site as a place to call my own. A place to showcase my work and a sandbox for future projects. I'm just getting started with Web design and development, so this site is very much a work in progress as I learn new things. Thanks for checking it out!</p>
<h4>My Story</h4>
<p>I grew up on the south side of Chicago and have always been curious about the way things work. For as long as I can remember, I've been taking things apart and putting them back together. I still have a giant tub of Legos waiting for a young builder to come along.</p>
<p>Throughout school, new concepts came pretty easily to me, especially in the subjects of math and science. However, when applying to college I chose to study communications. While many people may think I took the "easy A," I actually learned new skills and concepts I probably never would have come across. I think it's made me a different person today, much more well-rounded.</p>
<p>When I graduated, and joined the working world, I quickly realized that any jobs I could find as a communications major I didn't actually want. I took a job in human resources and only lasted about six months. Again however, I feel like I learned a lot, especially about myself.</p> 
<p>As I looked for new jobs, an opening appeared with the Evans Scholars Foundation, a nonprofit that sends deserving young caddies to college. I knew the Evans Scholars quite well - they paid for my college education to Northwestern University. I couldn't pass up an opportunity to give back my time and talents to an organization that gave me so much. I took the job as Alumni Services Manager.</p>
<p>Part of my compensation was a stipend to be used towards a Master's degree. This time I knew I wanted to focus more on technology and so I enrolled in the Applied Technology program at DePaul's School for New Learning. This program combined the hard skills of software/technology with the softer business/communications skills.</p>
<p>Over the next three years, I worked during the day and took classes at night. I studied everything from Java programming to project management to ethics to leadership. I was starting to build out my software skills while still maintaining my communications skills. At the same time, I married my high school sweetheart and we moved to the city. Life was pretty busy.</p>
<p>When I finished my Masters, the Evans Scholars Foundation created a new position for me as IT Manager. I started maintaining all the hardware and software in the office and worked on their new website. I never actually studied web development, so I had to quickly teach myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Using Lynda.com, and other online tutorials, I learned enough to get by and found that I really enjoyed the challenge. I was actually building something. It felt good to be creative and have something to show for all my hard work.</p>
<p>I then stumbled across Udacity and took their Web Development course. From the start, I knew this was what I wanted to do. As I worked through the exercises, I entered a state of "flow". I was in the zone and thinking clearly. After that course, this website was born and I began the next chapter in my life. I want to focus on the Web and applications (that's where everything is headed anyway) and continue to grow my skills.</p>
<p>When I'm not thinking about technology, I like to spend my time with family and friends or learning something new. I enjoy cooking and have spent the last year on the Paleo diet. I don't know if I'll ever go back to eating fake, processed food. I love to read or watch a good movie and wouldn't pass up the opportunity for good conversation. My wife and I (along with our dog, Allie) just bought a house and moved to the suburbs. As everything changes again, I'm looking forward to what the future holds.</p>
